Please log tickets and issues at our [JIRA tracker](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/).

We use semantic version numbers for our releases, and recommend that users stay
as up-to-date as possible by upgrading to patch releases and minor releases as
they become available.

Bugfixes and ongoing development will occur in minor releases for the current
major version. Security fixes will be backported to a previous major version on
a best-effort basis, until the previous major version is no longer maintained.
